# Snake Game

### Description
This is a basic Snake game created with python using the turtle module. I used [this code](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-snake-game-using-turtle-in-python/) as a base to make the snake move and made some upgrades to it


### Controls
W - Up
S - Down
A - Left
D - Right


### Objetive
Win the game by eating 100 apples (reaching 1000 points). Note: each time you gain points the snake moves a little faster
